## Usage

### Session Management
The `Session` class manages trading sessions and provides methods to:
- Detect the current trading session (Tokyo, London, New York).
- Fetch high and low prices for previous sessions.
- Retrieve candle data for the current session.

```python
from ozo.session import Session

session = Session()
current_session = session.get_trading_session()
print("Current Session:", current_session)

# Get high and low prices of the previous session
high, low = session.get_high_low_old_session(current_session, "EURUSD", mt5.TIMEFRAME_M5)
print("High:", high, "Low:", low)
```

---

### Candle Analysis
The `Candles` class provides methods to:
- Fetch the last 10 closed candles.
- Identify bullish and bearish candles.
- Calculate the highest high and lowest low of a set of candles.

```python
from ozo.candles import Candles

candles = Candles()
last_10_candles = candles.get_last_10_closed_candles1("EURUSD", mt5.TIMEFRAME_M5)
bullish_candle = candles.get_bullish_candle(last_10_candles)
print("Bullish Candle:", bullish_candle)
```

---

### Trade Execution
The `Trade` class handles trade execution, including:
- Market buy and sell orders.
- Buy and sell limit orders.
- Setting stop-loss and take-profit levels.

```python
from ozo.trade import Trade

trade = Trade()
# Execute a buy trade
trade.enter_buy_trade("EURUSD", 0.1, 1.1000, 1.1100)

# Place a sell limit trade
trade.enter_sell_limit_trade("EURUSD", 0.1, 1.1100, 1.1000, 1.1050)
```

---

### Price Analysis
The `Price` class detects liquidity sweeps and determines the direction of price movements.

```python
from ozo.price import Price

price = Price()
direction, last_structure = price.late_enter(highest_price, lowest_price, candles)
print("Direction:", direction)
print("Last Structure:", last_structure)
```

---

### News and Liquidity Analysis
The `News` class checks for high-impact news events and bank holidays.

```python
from ozo.news import News

news = News()
result = news.check_forex_day("https://www.forexfactory.com/calendar")
print("Trading Day Quality:", result)
```

## Example Workflow

1. **Initialize MT5**:
   ```python
   import MetaTrader5 as mt5
   mt5.initialize()
   ```

2. **Detect Trading Session**:
   ```python
   from ozo.session import Session
   session = Session()
   current_session = session.get_trading_session()
   ```

3. **Fetch Candle Data**:
   ```python
   from ozo.candles import Candles
   candles = Candles()
   last_10_candles = candles.get_last_10_closed_candles1("EURUSD", mt5.TIMEFRAME_M5)
   ```

4. **Execute a Trade**:
   ```python
   from ozo.trade import Trade
   trade = Trade()
   trade.enter_buy_trade("EURUSD", 0.1, 1.1000, 1.1100)
